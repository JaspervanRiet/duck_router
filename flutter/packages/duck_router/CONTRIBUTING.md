# Contributing to DuckRouter

:duck: It's awesome that you want to contribute to DuckRouter. The effort itself is much appreciated.

The following are simple guidelines for contributing.

## Issue a Pull Request

- **Write an issue**: Please make sure an issue exists before you submit a pull request. This is useful because we want bugs to be documented well, and when making changes to the public API we want to agree on the approach that should be taken.

- **Write tests**: We want to hit a high bar of quality and reliability. We do that via having a high degree of testing. When adding new code, and especially when fixing a bug, please write a test.
